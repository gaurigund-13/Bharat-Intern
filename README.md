# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using a Gradient Boosting Classifier. The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset consists of the following columns:

- **PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived:** Binary indicator (0 or 1) representing whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass:** Ticket class (1, 2, or 3), indicating the socio-economic status of the passenger.
- **Name:** Passenger's name.
- **Sex:** Passenger's gender (male or female).
- **Age:** Passenger's age.
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings or spouses aboard.
- **Parch:** Number of parents or children aboard.
- **Ticket:** Ticket number.
- **Fare:** Fare paid for the ticket.
- **Cabin:** Cabin number.
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Libraries Used:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Programming Language:** Python
